Since chicken is not in our menu these days because of the bird flu cases nearby, we’ve been getting fish on Sundays. Many of us feel it’s becoming repetitive.

I’m planning to request the GSec to replace it with prawns biryani or mutton biryani like in other hostels. If you agree, please reply here so we can show it’s a common request from many students.
10/08/2025, 10:46 - +91 95022 71660: Agreed!!!

20/08/2025, 19:01 - +91 93467 38788: *Ahem, Ahem… Attention please!* 🙏

The UG Rep has finally asked *when WE want the buses to run*. Remember:

* Missing a bus by a minute ➜ missing a lecture (or slogging 30 min in the sun/rain).
* Squeezing onto an over-packed bus before an exam.
* Wasting an hour a day on cycles because the schedule is off.

*Solution we want:*

*One bus every 15 minutes, up & down between hostels and the academic area.*
 No separate half-empty buses, no 30/45 min gaps—just a steady shuttle so nobody’s late

*Action:*

1. Open the form 👉  https://forms.gle/LQHRA984FTYXX8xf9
2. In the “Remarks” box, paste this (or write in your own words):

   ```
   Please run a single shuttle every 15 minutes between hostels and the academic section. This keeps wait times low and removes the need for multiple half-empty buses.
   ```
3. Share this message with every hostel group— *the more voices, the stronger our case.* 

Let’s speak up now so they finally put our convenience first. 💪🚌

The 3 hour session will be divided into two parts, the first 1 hour will be a theory session about what is gemini and GenAI. And next will be hands on workshop for remaining time where students will be provided with cloud credits to run the workshop. This has been conveyed by the Google and hack2skill team. 

Hoping to see you all there tomorrow.
